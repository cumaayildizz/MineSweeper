 Mini mine sweeper game (text-console) java
 The game is text-based and can only be played on console.
 An interface has not been defined for the game.
 The aim of the game: to open all the empty squares without stepping on the mine.
If we can achieve this, we win the game; if we step on the mine, we lose.
To give us a clue in the game, the game checks for mines in the squares around the square we choose (including diagonals);
If there are mines in the surrounding squares, the number of filled squares is written on the screen. If there is no mine in any box around, 0 is written on the screen.
The game is played using coordinates.
In the map consisting of Rows and Columns, simply enter the row and column codes that refer to the box you want to open on the screen and press the enter button.
Have a nice game....
